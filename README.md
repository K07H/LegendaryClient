LegendaryClient
===============

Beautiful, fully-featured League of Legends client.

This repositoy is currently not up-to-date due to legal issues. I don't want Riot coming after me. I have attempted to contact them, and I am awaiting a reply before I push any more updates.

Prerequisites
=============

Currently this branch is very incomplete. I suggest you use master for the moment until this gets merged into master.

Build it yourself
=================

You need these DLLS:

* Awesomium
* Sqlite
* rtmps-sharp

You must compile these DLLS yourself:

* https://github.com/bladecoding/Jabber-net

In-Client Screenshots
=====================

These screenshots are in progress and may not represent the final look of the client.

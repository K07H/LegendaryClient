LegendaryClient
===============

This client is discontinued due to a request from Riot. No more pull requests or code will be committed to this repository. No more support will be provided either. Hopefully some stuff from this client can be implemented in the Official client, though.

It was a fun project, and I had lots of fun developing it. I knew there was a possibility that it would not be allowed by Riot (especially after Wintermint), but it has certainly helped me with WPF and improving my C#. While I will leave my source code as it is (no point taking it down), I ask that people don't continue this project, you are just wasting time. If you want to improve League of Legends, create a smaller project, or apply for a [job at Riot](http://www.riotgames.com/careers). The source code is not fully up-to-date (around ~5000 lines behind the final client), but is a good indicator of what is needed for a client.

------------------------------------

This project has been superseded by an in-house project called Breeze (Only available for demonstration).
